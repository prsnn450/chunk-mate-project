# Chunk Mate

Chunk Mate is a web application designed to allow users to upload documents, process them into logical fragments (chunks), and review previously processed documents along with their associated chunks. This application is built using a React frontend and an Express.js backend, with a PostgreSQL database for data storage.

## Features

1. **Document Upload**: Users can upload markdown files (.md) through a user-friendly interface.
2. **Server-Side Document Chunking**: Uploaded documents are processed on the server, dividing them into chunks based on paragraphs and sections.
3. **Document History**: Users can view a history of all uploaded documents and their corresponding chunks.
4. **Chunk Management**: Each chunk can be displayed with its context, and users can download or copy chunks for reuse.
